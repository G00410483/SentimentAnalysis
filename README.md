Sentiment Analysis Application 

This Java-based application provides a CLI for performing sentiment analysis on textual data, such as 
tweets, using a lexicon-based approach. The application is designed to analyze the sentiment of 
textual data, with a particular focus on social media content such as tweets. 

Leveraging a lexicon-based approach, it assesses the sentiment of individual words by referencing a comprehensive 
lexicon, where each word is associated with a sentiment score. The application then aggregates 
these scores to compute an overall sentiment for the provided text, offering valuable insights into 
the emotional tone conveyed by the data.
